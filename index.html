            <strong>Hi Y'all!</strong> I'm Kevin Fukuhara, South-Seattle born and rasied. I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington's Electrical Engineering department and found myself at a job with T-Mobile about two years ago. Back at UW, I managed a research project within the department. My project has lead me to my involvement as team-lead in the development of a medical-service start-up called 'OstomyTech', in which our purpose is to introduce the field of ostomy-care to cutting edge technology and smart solutions. Throughout my experience, I have had the opportunities to (1) co-develop more than four written, professional proposals for government funding over quarter million dollars, (2)present our innovation in front of dozens of investors, medical specialists, and potential partners, and (3) supervise the software development and its integration with the hardware our project intends to utilize. 
 
        </p>

        <p  class="bodyPadding" id="bottomParagraph">To this day I am really interested in entrepreneurship. I am excited to join this class so that I can pursue more projects like the one I lead back in college, however this time I would be one of the developers in addition to leading. You've gotten this far without clicking out, so for that, thank you! Hope to meet you soon. </p>
